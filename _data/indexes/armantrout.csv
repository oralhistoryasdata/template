0:00,Introduction and Interview Setup,"Devin Becker introduces the three-part interview structure: current work practices, professional career progression, and impact of computers on writing. The interview will focus on how digital technology has influenced Armantrout's creative process."
01:43,Current Writing Practice and Devices,"Armantrout describes working primarily in poetry, occasionally in essays. She owns an iPad and two Dell computers (home and work), though she rarely uses the work computer for writing."
3:13,Between Notebooks and Digital Devices,"Armantrout's multi-stage process: starts in physical notebooks with illegible text, types drafts into iPad and emails to herself or Ron Silliman for feedback, then moves to upstairs computer for final work. She prints out multiple versions."
5:00,Notebooks as Primary Tool,"Discussion of Armantrout's extensive notebook collection (hundreds, possibly thousands). She prefers flexible, purse-sized notebooks that are inexpensive. She has donated many notebooks to archives at Stanford and UC-San Diego."
8:26,Thesis Binders for Manuscript Organization,"Armantrout shows her thesis binders, old-fashioned tools she uses to order manuscript poems. These rare binders, now sent to her by Lyn Hejinian, help her decide poem placement without spreading pages on floor or walls."
10:00,Digital Archiving Practices,"Discussion of file formats (.docx), saving habits (mostly saves over drafts, not ideal), naming conventions (poem titles, sometimes numbered), and backup practices (irregular zip drive backups, Gmail as accidental archive)."
13:24,Early Career and San Francisco,"Armantrout's path from San Diego State to Berkeley, studying with Denise Levertov, meeting Ron Silliman, and becoming part of the Language Poets community in San Francisco including Barrett Watten, Bob Perelman, Lyn Hejinian, Kit Robinson, and Carla Harryman."
15:25,Return to San Diego and Isolation,"Moving back to San Diego in late 1970s due to gentrification, pregnancy, and job opportunity felt like falling off a cliff before email. Armantrout maintained lengthy handwritten or typed correspondence with San Francisco poets, which now seems surreal."
17:03,Publishing History,"Early publications with small presses: The Figures (Jeff Young), Tuumba (Lyn Hejinian's letterpress), Burning Deck in Providence, Sun and Moon/Green Integer in Los Angeles, and eventually Wesleyan University Press in 2001."
20:00,Pre-Computer Writing Process,"Before computers, Armantrout's process stayed in handwritten phase longer. Typewriters were irritating due to mistakes requiring whiteout or starting over. She would only type when she thought she had a finished version, limiting the number of copies."
23:34,Getting the First Computer,"Armantrout got an IBM Selectric in mid-1980s, then her first computer by late 1980s with Word Perfect. Friend Ron Silliman, who worked in computer marketing, had one earlier. Internet access came in early 1990s."
25:00,Internet's Impact on Revision and Speed,"The internet enabled instant dialogue and feedback, dramatically changing Armantrout's writing speed. Email correspondence with Ron Silliman and others allowed real-time revision discussions, unlike letters where responses came too late to influence decisions."
30:00,iPad and Mobile Writing,"Armantrout got an iPhone about three years prior, iPad two years prior to interview. She finds iPhone too small for writing but uses iPad for typing early drafts while sitting comfortably downstairs before moving to upstairs computer."
33:00,Revision Process and Collaboration,"Armantrout discusses her obsessive focus on one poem at a time, seeking affirmation from readers (mainly Ron Silliman) before considering work finished. She revises for sound, meaning, and surprising connections between sections written on different days."
36:58,Thesis Binders History,"Armantrout has used thesis binders for 20-25 years. They were once common at readings but are now antique. She still uses them but finds them too heavy to carry, now printing poems out for readings instead."
39:00,Learning to Archive,"Armantrout wishes she had kept early letters from George Oppen and Robert Creeley. Watching Lyn Hejinian organize and sell her papers taught her that archives have value. Hejinian wrote letters as if writing for an archive."
42:31,First Email Experience,"Armantrout got her first email independently (not through UCSD) with help from her teenage son. Ron Silliman complimented that she had 'ramped up quickly' with email, a comment she remembers fondly."
46:00,Reading from Notebook to Finished Poem,"Armantrout reads the finished poem 'Particular' and traces its development from prose-like notebook entries through multiple revisions, showing how phrases evolved and sections were cut or transformed into the final work."
51:24,Poetry for Physicists Class,"Armantrout discusses preparing to team-teach with astrophysicist Bryan Keating, who was involved in South Pole cosmic inflation discovery. The class covers poetry about cosmology, objectivity/subjectivity, and constraint-based composition."
55:00,Email and Teaching,"Email arrived in the 1990s and changed teaching by making syllabi easier, allowing constant student contact, and enabling students to always find their professors. Armantrout feels that teaching young people keeps her somewhat current."
1:00:00,Computers and Content,"Armantrout discusses how computers have entered her poetry's content (poem referencing Mileage.com) and mentions digital poetry movements like Flarf poets' 'Google mining' and digital poems with words falling off screens at different rates."
