## About Oral History as Data

The [Oral History as Data (OHD)](https://github.com/oralhistoryasdata/) framework is a static website generator that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files. By turning transcriptions into tagged/coded CSV files, adding a list of filters, and creating a simple markdown file for each interview (to be included in the _transcripts collection), OHD will provide filterable transcripts and a color coded visualization for all transcripts included.
